## Accountability and Escalation

* Flagging Mechanism
    * Student missing 2 tests or 2 sessions is flagged automatically.
    * Flags visible on both mentor and admin dashboards.
* Escalation Path
    * Mentor → Chief Mentor → Program Director/Director
    * Director dashboard shows all flagged students
* Interventions
    * Automated mentor message (“You missed today’s test, please reschedule”)
    * If repeated, program director (or admin) calls for counselling

## Weekly Feedback

* Captured via web app, not Telegram.
* Structured form: performance + motivation + health + optional hours.

### Test Feedback

After every test, student gives quick feedback:
* Attendance (Yes/No).
* Test quality (rating or comment).
* Self-reflection (weak areas spotted).
* Mentor sees this before session → discussion becomes sharper and evidence-based.

### Escalation Path

* Program Director/Director → sees everything.
* Chief Mentor → supervises ~20 mentors, can see their students.
* Mentor → sees only their own students.
* Student → sees only their own plan + feedback.
