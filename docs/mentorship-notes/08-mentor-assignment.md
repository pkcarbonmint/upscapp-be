# Mentor Assignment Process

  Guiding Principles:
   * Actionable Notifications: Telegram messages are the primary interface for action.
   * One-Click Actions: Mentors can accept or decline with a single click.
   * Flexible Responses: A web form is available for non-standard responses.


  Step 1: Student Enters the Assignment Queue
   * A student completes payment and is added to the queue.
   * Proactive Telegram Notification: A message is sent to the Mentor Supervisor: "New student `[Student Name]` has joined the assignment queue for `[Optional Subject]`.
     Click here to assign a mentor: `[direct_link_to_assignment_page]`"

  Step 2: Mentor Supervisor Manages the Match
   * The Mentor Supervisor clicks the link and assigns the best-fit mentor based on Subject Expertise and Workload.

  Step 3: Mentor Receives an Actionable Offer with Buttons
   * The system sends a direct message to the chosen mentor. The message now includes interactive buttons for an immediate response.

      > Message:
      > "You have a new mentorship offer for student `[Student Name]` (`[Optional Subject]`). Please respond within 12 hours."
      >
      > Buttons:
      > [ Yes, I accept ]
      > [  No, I decline ]
      > [  Add Remarks / Conditional Acceptance ] (This button links to the web form)

  Step 4: Mentor Responds with a Single Click
   * The mentor clicks one of the buttons to proceed.

       * If `[ Yes, I accept ]` is clicked: The system instantly confirms the assignment and triggers the final step.
       * If `[  No, I decline ]` is clicked: The system immediately notifies the Mentor Supervisor that the offer was declined and the student needs a new assignment.
       * If `[  Add Remarks... ]` is clicked: The mentor is taken to the web form to provide a detailed response (e.g., conditional acceptance), which is then flagged
         for supervisor review.

   * Escalation: If no action is taken within 12 hours, the Mentor Supervisor is automatically notified to follow up.

  Step 5: Assignment is Finalized & Welcome Sequence is Triggered
   * Once the assignment is confirmed (typically after the "Yes" button is clicked):
       * The student's dashboard is activated.
       * Proactive Telegram Notification (to Student): "Great news! Your mentor, `[Mentor Name]`, has been assigned..."
       * Proactive Telegram Notification (to Mentor): "Assignment complete! Please send your personalized welcome message to `[Student Name]`..."
