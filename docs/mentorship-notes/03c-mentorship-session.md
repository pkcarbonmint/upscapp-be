## Mentorship Session Flow

* Mentor reviews: scores, accountability sheet, daily answers.
* Discussion: test performance, structuring answers, mental health check, motivation.
* Mentor can assign extra tasks (auto-added to student’s plan with deadlines).

### Session Closure

* Mentor clicks minimal buttons → generates crisp feedback PDF → auto-shared with student via Telegram/email.
* Mentor’s time spent logged automatically (for payment purposes).

### Optional Subjects

* Mentors won’t provide deep optional coaching.
* Standard guideline: “Focus on balancing GS and Optional hours; optional depth is self-driven.”
* Mentors can monitor time allocation, not content coaching.
