# Helios Engine Test Scenarios

This document outlines a diverse set of student personas to be used for testing the Helios study planning engine.

---

1. Priya (The Ambitious Achiever) -  Priya is preparing full-time
and can dedicate 50+ hours per week. She is confident in most subjects
but very weak in Economy and Ethics. She wants to tackle these weak
subjects first using an intensive, dual-subject study approach.

2. Ananth (The Working Professional) - Ananth is balancing
preparation with a full-time job, leaving him with 20-25 study hours
per week. He has average confidence and prefers to start with his
stronger subjects to build momentum, using a single-subject focus to
avoid being overwhelmed.

3. Rohan (The Overwhelmed Beginner) - Rohan is new to the material
and feels weak across almost all subjects. He has a moderate 35
hours/week to study and has chosen a "strong-first" approach to build
confidence on his *least weak* subjects, using a triple-focus approach
to get broad exposure.

4. Deepa (The Veteran Re-Taker) - Deepa has attempted the exam
before and is very confident in core subjects like Polity and History
but weak in her Optional and Essay. With moderate weekly study time,
she wants to quickly revise her strengths while dedicating significant
effort to her weak points, making a "weak-first," triple-focus
approach suitable.

5. Sanjay (The Balanced All-Rounder) - Sanjay represents the
average, consistent candidate with a 40-hour study week. He feels
"average" across most subjects and will use the default "weak-first"
pacing with a standard dual-focus approach to keep his preparation
balanced.

6. Aisha (The Long-Term Planner) - Aisha is a college student with
a two-year timeline and low weekly hours (15). As a beginner, she
feels "very weak" in most subjects and wants to build a solid
foundation slowly and steadily using a "weak-first," single-subject
focus.


7. Meera (The Optional–CSAT Bottleneck) - Meera has balanced GS
preparation and studies 35–40 hours per week. She is confident in core
subjects like Polity, History, and Geography, but repeatedly struggles
with her Optional and CSAT. She has even failed prelims once due to
CSAT. She wants to prioritise a CSAT + Optional-first approach while
keeping GS active through light revision and weekend tests. CSAT
killed more dreams in upsc than any other paper!
