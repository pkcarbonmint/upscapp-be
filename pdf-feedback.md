Differences between generated word docs and PDF docs
PDF Feedback:
1. No timeline SVG in PDF
2. Too much space between paragraphs
3. In plan overview, cycle names should be bold like in Word
4. Student Profile, some fields are not present in PDF
5. Cycle sections - missing cycle description below name. 
For example, in word we have "NCERT-based foundation building phase
focusing on basic concepts" under the heading "NCERT Foundation Cycle"
7. Table width is too narrow with lot of spacing on the right
8. Resources column content is differnet. In word docx file we have "History-Ancient	2025-03-01 - 2025-03-07 1 week(s)	NCERT, La Excellence Culture Material, Ancient/Medieval Prelims Workbooks, Newspapers (CA on Archaeology/Heritage)"
and in PDF we only have "NCERT".
9. In PDF we have, at the end of the resources section: "... and 13 more subjects with comprehensive resources". It should list all relevant resourcse, just like in Word files.
