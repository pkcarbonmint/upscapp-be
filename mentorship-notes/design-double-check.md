REview the notes in @mentorship-notes.md and [0-9]*.md files and double check the following:

1. Transitioning from current block to the next block happens smoothly.
2. If a mentor is unavailable for a week, what happens to the sessions?
3. If a mentor just leaves then what happens to the sessions?
4. Is Task the right abstraction to represent meetings like like weekly review?
5. Should we think of the different checkins as daily checkin, weekly checkin and monthly checkin? Where daily checkin driven by telegram, weekly checkin is driven by telegram and/or mentor and monthly checkin is also driven by telegram and/or mentor? At weekly checkins testing and review sessions are done. At monthly checkins rebalancing is done.
6. Subject and topic information is correctly used by Helios engine. Double check the interfaces/types/schemas and APIs.
7. Are we allowing the users (students and/or mentors) enough flexibility to change the plan?
8. Product config and purchase process is complete (check with Amit)
9. Test creation and linking is complete - how does it flow in the UIs?
10. Test evaluation integration is complete - how does it flow in the UIs?
11. Test scheduling and rescheduling is adequate & complete - how does it flow in the UIs?
12. What should task IDs look like, so that users can refer to them in telegram?
13. Structure of the overall UI and where the new pieces fit in
