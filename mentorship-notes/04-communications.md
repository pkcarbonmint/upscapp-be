### Rescheduling Procedures (MVP)

  Guiding Principle
  Our goal is to create a flexible and efficient rescheduling process that empowers students and mentors to manage their schedules directly. The administrative team
  should only be involved for exceptions, not as a routine part of the process.

  Standard Rescheduling Process
   1. Direct Communication: The person needing to reschedule (student or mentor) should initiate the request directly with the other party via Telegram, providing as much
      advance notice as possible.
   2. Mutual Agreement: The student and mentor are responsible for finding a new, mutually agreeable time for the session.
   3. Mentor Updates the Calendar: Once a new time is agreed upon, the mentor will edit the event in the shared calendar. This action serves as the official confirmation of
      the new schedule.
   4. Automated Notification: The shared calendar system will automatically send an updated invitation and notification to both the student and the mentor.

  Admin Escalation
  The Admin Assistant should only be contacted for rescheduling in the following situations:
   * Disagreement: If the student and mentor cannot agree on a new time after a reasonable effort.
   * No Response: If one party is unresponsive to a reschedule request.
   * Policy Issues: In cases of repeated last-minute cancellations or no-shows, which may require administrative intervention.

  System Requirements for MVP
   * A shared calendar system (e.g., Google Calendar) that is accessible to both students and mentors.
   * Mentors must have permission to edit and move the calendar events for their own sessions.
   * Automated email/app notifications for calendar updates must be enabled for all users.
