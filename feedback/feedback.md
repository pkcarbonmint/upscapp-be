1. Bird's eye view - a simple timeline instead of a calendar
2. Pages for blank weeks when start date is in the middle of a month
3. should we mention 30 min ? macro level only Optional time we can mention, then rest all time is for GS ?
(What does this mean?)
4. The planner is showing accurately new chapters to be read in a day.
5. Optional First strategy ? Sociology stopped from Nov 26 ? Nov 23 - 29 2025 
6. C1 is all about NCERT ? then the subjects and sources should reflect the same. Nov 30-Dec 06
7. IN C1 essay and Mains areas not needed sir, only NCERT + if optional first, focus on optional [3hours a day] + rest all time is for GS Foundation  Here in C1 Subjects like internal security and Essay doesn’t even come.
8. Internal Security is also not part of C1
9. Society NCERT is fine, and Social Justice also NCERT level.
10. Suddenly Sociology starting again after a unexplained break? Essay not needed at this stage sir. Here it is nicely showing RRP for optional, which should apply in earlier scheduling also.
11. Here C2 starts, we can plan with Major subject like Polity, economy, + minor subjects or one subject or One GS + optional etc, not with essay.(February 2026) 
12. Here C2 starts, we can plan with Major subject like Polity, economy, + minor subjects or one subject or One GS + optional etc, not with essay. (February 2026)
13. My suggestion after reading till here is first we can give, macro and weak wise schedules, then in the end mention resources week wise or subject wise sir, it breaks the flow or reading the scehdules and getting a grip on the planner.
14. Friday Feb 056 Guptas was assigned to read, now on Feb 10 Tuesday we are assigning for study + revision ? seems something is not clear.
Sunday 3 tests that too each for 3 hours each.  (Feb08 - Feb14)
